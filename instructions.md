## Printing

The high resolution image outputs at 8,192 x 10,922 pixels.  

Print 27.31" x 36.41" at 300dpi
Print 69.34cm x 92.47cm at 300dpi

Add `?forceWidth=xxxx` where xxxx is the pixels size you want. For example to print at 100cm high, the width would need to be 100cm. 100cm in inches is 39.37" at 300dpi = 11,811 pixels width. So using `?forceWidth=11811` and downloading will give you an PNG large enough to be safely printed at 1 meter height.
