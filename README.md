# HLR-example

A quick "stress test" for the new Hidden Line Removal feature of the AxiDraw tools.

This code is so I can quickly create 5,000+ overlapping rectangles, which can then be used to test the HLR option in the AxiDraw InkScape extension, CLI and Python.

## Installation

Clone the github repository into a folder, then open `index.html` in a browser.

The project has been designed to work on [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/) with [fx(params)](https://www.fxhash.xyz/doc/artist/params), to do this first install [fx(lens)](https://www.fxhash.xyz/doc/artist/fxlens) and follow those instructions on the [fxlens GitHub page](https://github.com/fxhash/fxlens#inspect-token-with-fxlens), section: "Inspect token with fx(lens)"

## Usage

If running the code locally, adjust the settings on the left until you have the desired results, then press 1-6 to download an SVG formatted to A1 to A6 in size.

Then run that through the Hidden Line Removal tool to see how long the tool takes on your system.

## This will be updated once the fxhash project has been published.
